# Vikings_Javascript_Team_Project
MVP

We have been tasked with creating an app that allows famous vikings to enter details about their battles.

The app should:

allow you to view the battles of each famous viking leaders.

allow you to add new battles that the viking has participated in.

allow you to update the vikings details depending on new battles.

allow you to view details of the norse gods.

allow you to delete the norse gods?????

The app should be build from the perspective of the vikings from 1000 years ago, and has recently been discovered by internet archaeologists. It will serve a modern day purpose of educating people on the activities of these famous vikings from their own perspective.
